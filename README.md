# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

stretch goal: filter, error handling front end back end, middleware to handle validations, Display errors to your user when they incorrectly fill out a form attempting to create or update a resource.
Add a one-to-many table relationship to your database.
Added human readable description and title even if user didnt input proper grammar. 
Visually allow for interacting with a second resource from the front-end.
