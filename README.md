(1) NavBar
* The NavBar allows me to navigate to the index, or new entry.

(2) Index Page
* I can see a list of todo's along with a toggle that will ask you to delete the todo since you're done.

(3) New Page
* Once a todo entry is created you are sent to that created todo entry along with having the first letter automatically capitalized.
* Gave validations to guide users to input the correct fields.

(4) Show Page / delete button
* I can see full details of a single entry along with having the option to delete, edit or go back.
* I can also see the checklists associated with that todo list, it has an edit and delete button along with a toggle that asks if you want to delete the checklist since you're done.

(5) Edit Page
* When I click on edit next to an entry I can see a form thats already prefilled with information on that entry and also give validation errors to guide the user to input the correct fields.

(6) Filtering
* Added a filter to filter the todos into there personal or work categories along with also being able to see all.

(7) UX/UI
* Used bootstrap to style every page, form, and button, along with having every page fit into smaller screens.

(8) Stretch Goals
* Display errors to users when they incorrectly fill out a form when attempting to create or update a resource.
* Added one-to-many table relationship to my database.
* Create middleware in back-end application to validate for particular values when a resource is created or updated.
* Visually allow for interacting with a secont resource from the front-end (checklist)
* Used re-usable helper functions for human readability for description and title even if user didnt input proper grammar.
* Fully functional toggle where if user says no on the delete modal for todo or checklist toggle it goes back to "incomplete (‚ùå)"
* Used useLocation to hide the navbar in the homepage to make the design more fluide (Not much point in a homepage except for introduction to the app for this project.)
* Added delete modals to every deletion possible along with 

(9) Implement more testing for edgecases along with writing one for each controller. 
(Bonus Feature for the future)
* Find and fix every edgecase possibly found.
